                <p>On 18 February 1946, a mutiny was declared on the HMIS Talwar, the Signal Training Establishment of the Royal Indian Navy, at Colaba, Bombay. A total of around 10,000 naval ratings took charge of 66 ships and on-shore naval establishments. On the fourth day of the strike the city’s industrial workers joined the struggle, and Bombay closed down. The curfew that followed ended with over 200 people killed on the streets. Ranged against the strikers was the might of the British armed forces, on sea, air and land, threatening ‘if necessary’ to wipe out the Navy.</p>
                <p>It lasted six days. Widely considered a 'failure' in its time, seventy years on, the naval insurrection refuses to be assimilated into any single narrative of history. It was a challenge to the Empire, shaking up a British patrician state and an imperial order, the full might of which was on display in the events that took place in Bombay. These maps move, in a progressively expanding narrative, from the events in the city to those in India and the British Empire.</p>

        <p>The Indian National Army trials (of captured members) began on November 5, 1945 at the Red Fort in Delhi, as three stalwarts of the Azad Hind Fauj — one a Muslim (Shahnawaz Khan), one a Hindu (Prem Sahgal) and one a Sikh (Gurbaksh Dhillon) — arrived at Subhas Bose’s ""Chalo Delhi"" destination in ironic ironclad circumstances.</p>

        <h3>February 2, 1946 - 0915</h3>
        <p>On February 8, an incident occurred which caused great excitement. The first parade for the Central Communications Office (CCO) ratings was at 9:15 a.m. While they were busy dressing in their barracks, the ·CO suddenly walked in and shouted: ""Get up, you sons of coolies; you sons of Indian bitches."" In surprise the boys turned round. The officer kept on shouting. Unmentionable filth poured out of his mouth. The CO departed, as he had come, in a storm of rage. It is probably true that the boys had failed to come to attention and salute him as he had entered the room. But then they were too busy getting ready for their parade. They decided not to bear these insults quietly any longer. But what were they to do? They could not complain collectively - according to regulations in the Navy they were not permitted to put up joint ""requests"". So the following morning fourteen ratings individually put in formal complaints against Commander King’s language. The complaints were heard by Lt. Commander Snow, Executive Officer, and referred to the CO on February 10. This officer sensed the deep discontent of the men and sent a personal and confidential letter to Commander King asking him to deal with the matter quickly and tactfully. Meanwhile, Admiral Godfrey, sitting in Karachi, has had enough.</p>

        <p>In the meantime things had been moving fast round the Hindustan. In the morning, the army authorities had brought up two platoons (about 60 men) of the Baluch Regiment. They were ordered to board the Hindustan. They had heard that the ratings were on strike and refused to go into action against them. The General was informed. He promptly decided to send two platoons of Gurkhas from the 2nd Battalion of the 777 Indian Parachute Brigade. ""They are the most dependable troops and fine fighters,"" he said. The General was wrong. The Gurkhas too refused to attack their own brothers. Now British troops were brought in. It was about ten-thirty when two platoons of the Black Watch Regiment appeared on the jetty alongside the Hindustan. The ratings from Manora island had also been followed by some military in a boat. ""When the landing-craft neared the jetty they realised that something was afoot, so, instead of landing, they made straight for the Hindustan. Two batches managed to get in. The third was prevented and diverted by the military. There were now 600 ratings on the Hindustan. The men ordered all the officers except the doctor to leave the ship. The Captain at first refused. Finally he saw that he had no alternative. While going down, however, he fired a shot from his revolver. This was a signal for the British troops to attack. They attempted to board the ship. The ratings hastily put up a big notice: ""IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR LIVES, DO NOT COME UP.""</p>

Another signal was received from the Castle Barracks that 20 persons had been shot. After this, and after the speech, ammunition and guns were manned.

        <p>Admiral's broadcast was heard and it had considerable effect. The ratings did not understand that there was no such thing as a strike, and that a mutiny is a very serious matter.</p>

        <h3>February 22, 1946 - 1030</h3>
        <p>At about 10:30 a.m., the British troops suddenly opened fire with all their weapons. It was a very critical situation. The ratings on the Hindustan knew that with the low level of the ship they could not hit back effectively, but they decided to fight back as long as they could. In face of the heavy machine-gun and mortar fire, the gun crews could scarcely approach the guns. Those who dared could not elevate their guns sufficiently, because of the low tide, to bring them on to the target. They were handicapped in every way. What was more, they were afraid that if their shots went wide there was danger of their hitting the neighbouring village of Keamari, a working-class stronghold. Still, they fired back, as best as they could. Two of their shells landed close to the General's Office. The old General and his staff had to spend a panicky hour inside trenches. For twenty-five minutes the unequal battle continued, but it was impossible to continue it much longer; six of the ratings had been killed, about thirty were wounded, their shots were going wide. It would have been suicide to continue. They decided to surrender. With bullets still flying all round, a brave young rating, a mere boy, went up on the bridge with a white flag. For a moment the firing stopped, but the gunners were ordered to fire again. A 75-millimetre shell hit the boy with the white flag. Thus the brave resistance of the Hindustan came to an end as the ratings gathered round the fragments of the body of the young martyr. The British gunners went back saying: ""What a heroic resistance! They are heroes and not criminals. It was a dirty job we had. Why did the officer have to blow up that little boy? It was shameful."" In Keamari, the workers whispered: ""The poor boys. Why did they surrender? Why did they lay down their weapons? Were they afraid that they would hurt us? What of that! They should have fought to the last. They should not have surrendered."" Tears rolled down their furrowed faces. British troops now occupied the Hindustan. The leading ratings were arrested and removed to Malir Camp that very afternoon. In the evening a battalion of British paratroopers occupied Manora island and surrounded the establishments. For eighteen days they remained and all the ratings were virtually under arrest. Thus ended the great Naval strike at Karachi.</p>

        <p>I have followed the events now happening in India with painful interest. This mutiny in the navy and what is following is not, in any sense of the term, non-violent action. Inasmuch as a single person is compelled to shout “Jai Hind” or any popular slogan, a nail is driven into the coffin of swaraj in terms of the dumb millions of India. Destruction of churches and the like is not the way to swaraj as defined by the Congress.</p>
